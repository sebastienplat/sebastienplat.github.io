As seen in the notebook, the organizers did not pair the images randomly: doing so would have led to a very unbalanced dataset with almost no matching pairs. To prevent this and create a balanced dataset, they used a distinct repeating pattern that we are able to reverse-engineer to our advantage: they linked images in clusters of 22 IDs. Only 15 of them have the same class; they are all linked to the 21 others images of the cluster. The other 7 are only linked to the 15 images that have the same class and not to each other. It's this pattern that we capture with the incidence matrix. To go a little further: IDs are either in 21 or 36 pairs. The IDs in 21 pairs only have links inside their cluster. the IDs with 36 pairs have 21 pairs in the cluster of their class and 15 pairs in another cluster of another class (this allows to create connections betwee clusters) .
