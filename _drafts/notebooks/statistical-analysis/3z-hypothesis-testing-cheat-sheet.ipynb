    "A more common measure is the **[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Pearson's_product-moment_coefficient)**, built on top of the covariance. It's akin to the standard variation vs the variance for bivariate data and represents how far the relationship is from the line of best fit.\n",
