    "#### Goal of Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Statistical Inference is to draw conclusion about a whole population by studying only a sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling must be probabilistic in order to make inference about the whole population. Otherwise, the inference can only be made about the sample itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img class=\"center-block\" src=\"https://sebastienplat.s3.amazonaws.com/ac0925d493878aa2e4c640dfa7dad1741489593445684\" style=\"max-width:300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [**Simple random sample**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample) – each subject in the population has an equal chance of being selected\n",
    "+ [**Stratified random sample**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) – the population is divided into groups based on some characteristic (e.g. sex, geographic region). Then simple random sampling is done for each group\n",
    "+ [**Cluster sample**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling) – a random cluster of subjects is selected from the population\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies look for relationships between different parameters of a population:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Explanatory** variables called **predictors** (or independent variables) \n",
    "+ **Response** variable called **outcome** (or dependent variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Observational** – measures the relationship between variables\n",
    "+ **Experimental** – involves the random assignment of a treatment; researchers can draw causal conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental studies must be carefully designed to conclude that differences in the results of an experiment, not reasonably attributable to chance, are likely caused by the treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Control**: control for effects due to factors other than the ones of primary interest\n",
    "+ **Random selection**: subjects should be randomly selected from the population\n",
    "+ **Random assignment**: subjects should be randomly divided into the different groups\n",
    "+ **Replication**: there should be enough subjects participating to the study, so the randomization creates groups that resemble each other closely and to increase the chances of detecting differences among the treatments if they exist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random selection** ensures that the study results can be **extended** to the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random assignment** of treatment avoid unintentional selection bias. Significant results can be concluded as **causal**, ie. the treatment caused the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A study with both random selection and random assignment is a **completely randomized experiment**.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a quantity whose value changes. \n",
    " \n",
    "+ a **discrete** variable is a variable whose value is obtained by counting\n",
    "+ a **continuous** variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random variable** is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a physical phenomenon: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ an experiment: result of a coin toss, etc. \n",
    "+ an industrial process: default rate in manufacturing, etc.\n",
    "+ a naturally occuring event: people's height, etc.\n",
    "+ ...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to describe a random variable. Here are the most common ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "A [**probability distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) of a random variable X tells what the **possible values** of X are and what **probability** each value has.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the outcome of a coin toss X. The probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for Heads and 0.5 for Tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several probability distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [**Probability Mass Function**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function), or PMF, for **discrete** variables\n",
    "+ [**Categorical Distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution) for **discrete** variables with a **finite** set of values\n",
    "+ [**Probability Density Function**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function), or PDF, for **continuous** variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**Cumulative Distribution Function**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) is the probability that a random variable X will take a value less than or equal to x. It is the cumulative sum (or integral) of the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Central Tendancy\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common ways to measure [central tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [**mode**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics&#41;): value that occurs most often in the data\n",
    "+ [**median**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median): middle value of the ordered data\n",
    "+ [ **mean**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean): average of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is not skewed much by extremely large or small values. So it may give a better idea of a 'typical' value than the mean. This is also why it is considered a [**robust statistic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below illustrates the definition of mode, median and mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-height:300px;\" src=\"https://sebastienplat.s3.amazonaws.com/e4b73954b4944120752f1082b78ed3cc1489605907921\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Many applied statistical methods require the assumption that the data is normal, or very near bell-shaped. This is why data transformation is often necessary for skewed distributions (log transform, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the centreal tendency, it is useful to measure the [**variability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) of data, also called **spread** or statistical dispersion. It is zero if all the data are the same and increases as the data become more diverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most measures of dispersion have the same units as the quantity being measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common ways to measure it:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [**Range**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics&#41;): maximum minus minimum (see also [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_maximum_and_minimum))\n",
    "+  [**Interquartile range (IQR)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range): the difference between the thrid and first quartile\n",
    "+ [**Standard Deviation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation): square root of the variance, the average squared distance from the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "**Range** is easy to calculate, but is extremely sensitive to outliers and therefore the least robust measure of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interquartile Range\n",
    "\n",
    "A [**percentile**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) indicates the value below which falls a given percentage of observations in a data set. The **median** is the **50th percentile**: Fifty percent or the observations fall at or below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous variables, percentiles represent the area under the PDF. The following graph shows the example of a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"https://sebastienplat.s3.amazonaws.com/8453b91f3e6f877d096d69951b5c78051489661658479\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quartiles** divide a rank-ordered data set into **four equal parts**. Each value has a 25% probability of falling into either of the four parts.\n",
    " \n",
    "The values that divide each part are called the first, second, and third quartiles; they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively. The [**Interquartile range (IQR)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) is equal to Q3 minus Q1. This is why it is sometimes called the **midspread** or **middle 50%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph shows the quartiles of a bell-shaped distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"https://sebastienplat.s3.amazonaws.com/4ffc9f174b46ac4bec5fcd6df42b65d81489662410273\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Box-Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Box-plots**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) are a good way to summarize a distribution using its quartiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ the **box** always shows the **IQR with the median** inside\n",
    "+ the **whiskers** representation can vary\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used by statistical softwares is the **Tukey boxplot**:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ the whiskers extend until the smallest and highest values within **1.5 IQR** of Q1 and Q3 respectively\n",
    "+ the remaining values are considered as **outliers** and represented individually\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance** is the average squared distance from the mean. **Standard deviation** is the square root of the variance. It has the **same unit** as the variable itself and its typical notation is $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**68–95–99.7 rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) states that \"nearly all\" values lie within three standard deviations of the mean. For a normal distribution, the probability that any value falls within 3 $\\sigma$ of the mean is approx. 99.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"https://sebastienplat.s3.amazonaws.com/ae16863c2895a36e3d00721cefd9d0921489748975006\"/>\n",
